# bevy15-learning-project
A dumb little project for playing with Bevy 15, might end up as a soulslike someday


The primary objective of this project is for me to develop a game in bevy using as little external crates as possible, rolling my own whenever bevy itself does not provide a solution

I'm hoping to eventually make a game that is a Pathfinder 2e Soulslike which is gonna be funky as hell :3

# Licensing

For now this is MIT since that seems reasonable. I don't think too hard about licensing for my learning projects so do whatever I guess?
